## Pop Balloons ... but Quickly!

For this week's assignment, I hope to program a game in which the user has to pop as many balloons as they can within a given amount of time using computer vision. My code will be based on the homework I submitted on April 7th, in which an infinite amount of balloons go up and can get "popped" by hovering the mouse over them for awhile. This week, I will try to to modify/add onto the program so that the balloons are popped with a "needle" (which will be a pen/object in real life) and  a counter as well as a win/lose condition are implemented, turning the program into a game.

I will use color tracking computer vision, in which the user moves around a certain-colored marker/object, which will serve as a "needle" that will pop the balloons on the screen.
