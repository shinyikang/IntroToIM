## Pop Balloons ... but Quickly!

For this week's assignment, I hope to program a game where the user has to pop as many balloons as they can within a given amount of time using computer vision. My code will be based on the homework I submitted on April 7th, in which an infinite amount of balloons go up and can get "popped" by hovering the mouse over them for awhile. This week, I will try to to modify/add onto the program so that the balloons are popped with a "needle" that will be a pen/object in real life. A counter (for how many balloons have been popped) as well as a win/lose condition will also be implemented, turning the program into a game.

I will use color tracking computer vision, under which the user moves around a certain-colored marker/object, or a "needle", to pop the balloons on the screen.
